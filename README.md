It mainly releases classification models and regression models. Among them, the classification models include Bernoulli_RF_model and Bernoulli_XGB_model, while the regression models include Wave_CNN_RF_model and Wave_CNN_XGB_model. Other basic models (such as XGB and RF) can be built by readers based on their own needs.
